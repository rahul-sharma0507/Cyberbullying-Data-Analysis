# Cyberbullying Severity Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Cyberbullying Severity Detection** by analyzing social media data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify online text into different levels of toxicity to help automate the identification of harmful content.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Exploration of cyberbullying datasets to understand patterns in toxic behavior.
- **Severity Classification:** Multi-class classification to detect the intensity of cyberbullying (e.g., Ageism, Racism, Religion, etc.).
- **NLP Pipeline:** Text preprocessing including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of advanced ML models using Python and Hugging Face.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- **NLP Libraries** (NLTK, Transformers)
- **Google Colab** (for GPU-accelerated training)
- **Hugging Face Hub** (for pre-trained models)

## How to Run the Project
1. Click the **"Open in Colab"** button above to launch the notebook.
2. Add your Hugging Face API key to the Colab "Secrets" (Key icon) as `HF_TOKEN`.
3. Run all cells to see the data analysis and model results.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing thousands of tweets labeled by the type and severity of cyberbullying.
